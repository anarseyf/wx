# Overview

This project uses a Wi-Fi module to request weather data from a public API and display it on an E-Paper display. Weather is only fetched every 6 hours, and power consumption is reduced to a few microamperes when not updating. The display requires no power when not updating, which is perfect for this application. The widget is powered by two batteries serving distinct purposes. Photos below.

# Components

* [4.3 Inch E-Paper display](www.waveshare.com/wiki/4.3inch_e-Paper)
* [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/collections/photon)
* Arduino Uno
* 9V battery (powers the Arduino and the display)
* Small 3.7V rechargeable battery (powers the Photon only)
* TIP-120 Transistor (turns off power to Arduino and display except when updating)

# How it works
## Logic
* Photon and Arduino establish communication via I2C. Photon is Master, Arduino is Slave.
* Photon requests and receives ZIP code from Arduino (this is hard.
* Photon publishes an event called **wx-request**, which is tied to a Particle [Webhook](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/webhooks/):
```C
Particle.subscribe("wx-data", dataHandler, MY_DEVICES);
...
Particle.publish("wx-request", zip, PRIVATE);
```
* The webhook creates an HTTP request to OpenWeatherMap in this format:
```http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?APPID=<app-id>&zip=<ZIP>,US&units=metric```
  * *app-id* is my unique OpenWeatherMap API key; it's configured as a parameter in the Webhook
  * *zip* comes from **wx-request**.
* *dataHandler* collects partial responses (the full response is larger than Particle's payload limit, which I think is 256 bytes).
* Photon parses the response using the ```SparkJson``` library:
```C
StaticJsonBuffer<12000> buffer;
...
JsonObject& json = buffer.parseObject((char*)apiResponse.c_str());
```
The necessary fields are extracted. This includes a code for the weather icon.
* The result is sent to Arduino via I2C. It looks like this:

Wed,Apr 11,0/-4,09d
Thu,Apr 12,-2/-5,10d
Fri,Apr 13,30/19,50d
```
* Arduino parses the message, and renders the data on the screen. The last item is converted to an image name; for example, ```09d``` becomes ```09D.BMP```.
## Hardware

* Sleep; force sleep
Particle has an excellent low-power mode. In Deep Sleep it only consumes a handful of microamperes. At the end of the specified sleep period the chip restarts.
```C
System.sleep(SLEEP_MODE_DEEP, DEEP_SLEEP_SECONDS);
```
* E-Paper: this display consumes no power except when updating.
* SD Card: 
  * the `epd_disp_bitmap()` function can be used to load BMP images from the display's memory. These are initially loaded from a micro-SD card, then copied to internal flash memory.
* Acrylic case:
  * I sent Acrobat files with laser cutting specs for top and bottom cover to [Pagoda Arts](pagodaarts.com), located in San Francisco. They cut an 1/8" sheet of acrylic to these specs. See photo below.
* Transistor: used to turn off the unnecessary components when not updating. An update happens once every 6 hours, and this allows us to use very little power most of the time.
* Current:
  * Photon: normal 50mA, deep sleep 50ÂµA (very rough numbers)
  * Arduino Uno: 50mA
  * E-Paper display: 150-200mA when updating
* Voltage:
  * Photon: Accepts 3.3-5V (bad idea to plug in a 9V battery directly, as I've found out)
  * Arduino Uno: Accepts 9V Vin (has a voltage regulator)
  * E-Paper display: accepts both 3.3V and 5V.

## Libraries used

* SparkJson
* Wire (I2C)
* [EPD](https://github.com/sabas1080/LibraryEPD/)
  * The EPD library is modified to include a function called [epd_import_sd()](/libraries/epd-modified/epd.cpp#L782). This allows copying images from the SD card to the display's built-in NandFlash memory. This removes the need to have an SD card always plugged in, which is good because it seems to corrupt SD cards once in a while.
  
# Various
* Why even use an Arduino?
  * The main reason is that I couldn't get the EPD library to run on the Photon. Besides it's more fun this way :-)

# Future plans (version 2)
* ZIP code entry plug-in
* Even less power (Arduino Pro Mini)
